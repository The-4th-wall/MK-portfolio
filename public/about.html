<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey! I'm a highschooler that just loves drawing and playing videogames! If there is anything I can do it's coming up with various ideas and not backing down till it's time to give up. My prime motivator is "Never back down! Never what? NEVER GIVE UP!!!" </p>

<p>Some of the best games out there I've played gotta be Persona 3: Reload and the Ace Attorney Trilogy. Also I love reading as well, totally check out Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint! Amazing novel!!</p>
