<h2>My top three favorite movies in the past year</h2> 
<hr />

<h3>Bullet Train</h3>
<p>Bullet Train follows "Ladybug" as he tries to retrieve a briefcase in replacement for his sick collegue. Unbeknowsst to him various other agents are placed on the train with their own goals. "The Father" in search of his son's attacker, "Lemon" and "Tangerine" tasked to protect "The Son" and deliever it to the a Russian Yakuza known as "The White Death".</p> 
<p>This movie was quite bloody but showcased excellent use of makeup and acting. The characters were the best part of the film as "Ladybug" tried to piece what was even going on in the Bullet Train. Out of all the various characters in the cast, "Lemon" and "Tangerine's" brotherly duo stuck out the most. The most impressive part was how this all took place on one train in the events of a day. </p>

<h3>Spider-man: Across the Spider-verse</h3>
<p> ASTV picks up a few short years after ISTV with Miles Morales figuring out how to balance his life as Spider-man and Miles Morales. Along with a look into Miles' life we see how Gwen Stacey is dealing with her own issues in Earth-65. Gwen's father, George, is hunting for Spider-woman to avenge the death of Peter Parker unaware the boy's death was caused by an accident. This causes a strain in the relationship between Gwen and her father leading for Gwen to meet Miguel O' Hara and Jess Drew, spidermen from another universe trying to fix the effects of the collider seen in ISTV. Gwen later returns Earth 1610 to meet Miles and to investiagte the Spot, who leds them to another alternate universe where they meet Pavitr and Hobie Brown and fight against the Spot. Shortly afterwards, Miles Morales comes to learn that the "canon" dictates how Spiderverse is supposed to be run and no one should ever break it. </p>
<p> ASTV was a beautiful film just as ISTV was. The character designs being the best feature of the film. The way the designers figured out how to make Miles still look the same but show some growth between ISTV and ASTV was just genius. The difference in coloring and styles for the various worlds that the viewer got brief glimpses into. Along with the foreshadowing shown in all aspects of the movie and how well it connected to Istv (which can be watched as a standalone). The film never failed to keep me on the edge of my seat and the soundrack is just spectacular. I can not wait to see Beyond The Spider-verse. </p>
<h3>Suzume </h3>
<p>The film follows 17-year-old high school girl Suzume Iwato and young stranger Souta Munakata, who team up to prevent a series of disasters across Japan by sealing doors from the colossal, supernatural worm that causes earthquakes after being released. (Wikipedia)</p>
<p>Despite being known as the "chair movie", it greatly suprised me. The trailer made the film appear as if it was entirely about a girl falling in love with a chair (and thankfully it was not) when in actuallity it embraced the idea of growing and moving forward. Suzume and Souta's relationship was my favorite part despite the two not originally liking each other, I loved how they progressively grew and were willing to do what it takes to help the other live. The soundtrack was one the best parts of the film along with the beautiful colors. </p>
